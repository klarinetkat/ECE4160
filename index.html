                                Lab 2's purpose is to establish a bluetooth connection between our computer and the Artemis board.
                                We will use Jupyter notebook to code in Python and the Arduino IDE for the Artemis. 
                                In future labs we will use bluetooth to communicate between the Artemis and our laptops.

                                <p>
                                    In order to set up the computer, we had to install Python 3 and pip if they weren't installed already. I also created and activated
                                    a new virtual environment called "FastRbots_ble" which will be used for labs in this course. Within this specific virtual environment
                                    I downloaded the proper packages including 'numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio bleak jupyterlab' so I can run jupyter lab. At this point,
                                    I also downloaded the codebase into my project directory. In addition, to set up the Artemis Board I downloaded the ArdinoBLE library and 
                                    ran the sketch ble_arduino.ino to view the MAC address of the artemis board.
                                </p>
                                <img src="assets\img\lab2\Lab2PrelabMACAddress.png" alt="mac address" />

                                <p>
                                    The code base ble_robot-1.1 contains two sub-directories ble_arduino and ble_python. ble_arduino contains the main ble_arduino.ino 
                                    file that we edit in this lab and class definition files. ble_python contains all the files that run in jupyter labs. demo.ipynb is
                                    the main Jupyter Notebook that we can use to run commands and it relies on information from the other files. 
                                    When we run ble_arduino we find out the MAC address of the Artemis which can afterwards be put in connections.yaml. Also, in 
                                    jupyter lab we can randomly generate a uuid which is then copied into connections.yaml and ble_arduino.
                                    In addition, we add a command case to ble_arduino.ino we have to include it in cmd_types.py.

                                    First I ran the ble_arduino file in arduino to get the mac address of the Artemis board (as done in the prelab) and randomly 
                                    generated a uuid in jupyter labs. Afterwards, I updated these values connections.yaml file.

                                    I ran into a lot of issues when originally running the demo file. My personal laptop runs Windows 11, which at the time of the lab 
                                    was not able to properly establish a bluetooth connection between the arduino IDE and bluetooth in jupyter lab. I ended up using the 
                                    lab computers but it was to no avail. During the lab section it seemed other students were connecting to the board by accident while 
                                    I could not connect to it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After a week of testing things out, TA Alex posted step by step instructions for how to set up bluetooth communication on Windows 11
                                    It was very helpful and I was finally able to start making progress on the lab.
                                </p>

                                    The ECHO command sends a specific string to the Artemis board and the Artemis sends back the string to the computer. This is done 
                                    with interactions between a jupter notebook file and the arduino IDE. In juptyer I called ble.send_command(CMD.COMMAND, "some string") 
                                    to send the command to Arduino's switch-case statements. I almost forgot to add the command to the CommandTypes enum and the cmd.types.py file.

                                    This task also used the ble.send_command() and ble.receive_string() to send and receive information bewteen the computer and Artemis. 
                                    I used millis() to get the current time in milliseconds and appended it to the string characteristic.

                                    I set up a notification handler and callback function to extract the time from the string sent from the Artemis command GET_TIME_MILLIS
                                    to the laptop. In order to extract the string, I had to first process the data. Since I knew the format of the string being received, 
                                    it was easy to splice the string depending on where there were colons and add all the times to an array of times.

                                    I added another case statement in the ble_arduino.ino file which sends an array of timestamped temperature readings that were taken
                                    once per second for five seconds. I followed the example temperature file from Lab 1 as a guide for how to read the temperature in

                                    The Artemis has 384 kB of RAM and we are asked to discuss the limitations of how much data we can store to send without running 
                                    out of memory in the form of "5 seconds of 16-bit values taken at 150 Hz". 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since we are transmitting 16-bit values at 150 Hz, we are transmitting 300 bytes per second or 1500 bytes every 5 seconds.
                                    If we divide our total amount of RAM 384 kB by 1500 bytes every 5 seconds, we can transmit 256 5-second intervals of data
                                    before running out of memory.

                                    The default address of the TOF sensor is 0x52. This informaton can be found on the VL53L0X datasheet.

                                <p>
                                    There are two approaches for using two TOF Sensors in parallel because they both have the same address. The first option is to
                                    turn off one TOF sensor during set-up, changing the address of the other sensor, and then turning the TOF sensor back on. At this 
                                    point, both TOF sensors would have different addresses and you can read data from both at the same time. The second option is to keep
                                    both TOF sensors with the same address but alternate between turning on and off one sensor when you want to read data from the other one.
                                    An issue that may arise later on is the delay when waiting for the sensors to start back up.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I decided to go with the first option because I don't want to deal with delays later on when my robot is navigating and doing stunts. In addition,
                                    I only have to solder the XSHUT pin on one of the TOF sensors to a GPIO pin (I chose GPIO 8) on the Artemis.

                                <p>
                                    There are many different options for how to place the sensors on the robot. The first option is having a sensor on the left and right sides of 
                                    the robot however this means the robot will be unable to detect objects that are in front of it. The second option is having a sensor on the 
                                    front and another sensor on one side. This allows for the robot to see in front, but it can cause issues of the robot is coming close to an 
                                    obstacle on the side without the sensor. The third option is to place both sensors at an angle on the front of the robot. This allow for the
                                    sensors to see both in front and to the sides. One thing to think about is how to process that data to give reliable and useful information
                                    if the sensors are at an angle.

                                    As mentioned in the prelab, the default address of the TOF sensor is 0x52. However, when scanning for I2C devices the address is 
                                    0x29 which is equal to 0x52 bitshifted to the right. The least significant bit is used to determine if the device is read/written.

                                    The TOF sensor we are using has two measure modes. The short distance mode is used by default which measures up to 1.3 m. The long 
                                    distance mode can meausure up to 4 m. For the purpose of this lab, I continued to use the default setting. It might be good to use 
                                    the long distance mode for the actual robot since it will be moving at a faster speed and needs enough time to react to obstacles

                                Lab 4's purpose is to familiarize oursevles with reading data from the IMU and understanding what is means. Also, run the Artemis with 
                                the sensors from a battery. The final task is to record a stunt of the RC car and graph the IMU and TOF data.

                                <p>
                                    In order to set up the IMU, we had to install the SParkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino library. 
                                    In the setup, AD0_VAL which represents the last but of the IMU's I2C address.
                                    AD0_VAL is set to 1 by default, but when the ADR jumper on the IMU is closed, it should be 0. In our case, the value is 1 because the ADR jumper is not closed.
                                    The basics example was run to see if IMU's accelerometer and gyroscope were properly measuring data. Below is a video of the example code running.

                                    In order to know that the board is running, I set the blue LED on the Artemis board to toggle on and off three times on start up.

                                    During lecture we went over the equations for pitch (rotation around the y-axis) and roll (rotation around the x-axis):

                                    I made a separate arduino file that initializes the IMU to collect data and print into the serial monitor in a specific format
                                    of "data1,data2" so I could plot the data in the Serial Plotter which receive the data from the same COM the Artemis is connect to.

                                <p>
                                    First, I used my lab box as a guide to make sure I was tilting the IMU by +/- 90 degrees about both the x- and y-axis. The images 
                                    below show the different orientations with the pitch and roll printed in the Serial Monitor and displayed in the Serial Plotter.
                                    For the serial monitor, it is printed as pitch,roll and for the Serial Plotter the pitch is in green and the roll is in red.

                                    When running the RC car in its proximity there is extra noise in the accelerometer data. I recorded some of this data 
                                    by running the car near the accelerometer. I send this data from the Artemis to Python using a modified version of the 
                                    bluetooth code from lab 2. In Jupyter lab, I took the FFT of the pitch and the roll which was slightly noisy. In order 
                                    to eliminate some of this noise, I implemented a low pass filter for both the pitch and roll.

                                    In lecture we also discussed the equations to compute the pitch, roll, and yaw using the gyroscope data:

                                    As shown in the video values output from the gyroscope are much more steady than the outputs from the accelerometer.
                                    However, overtime the offset accumulates to have a large magnitude.

                                    Similar to what was done in lab3, I checked each iteration of the loop for if the IMU was ready.
                                    I removed any of the extra print statements and delays and found the difference in time from before 
                                    and after checking if the IMU is ready using myICM.dataReady() and after calling myICM.getAGMT() which updates the values of the IMU.
                                    As shown in the screenshot, I can sample data as fast as 2-3 milliseconds.

                                    I integrated my code from Lab 3 to collect both ToF and IMU data and sent it over bluetooth 
                                    to my laptop. It could collect the data for 5s and then graphed the data using matplot. 
                                    I ended up using one big array formatted as a string to store the ToF, accelerometer, and 
                                    gyroscope data before sending it to Jupyter Lab. In Jupyter Lab, the string was received and 
                                    the data was extracted and separated it into smaller arrays.

                                    We have two different batteries. One 3.7V 850mAh for the motors and one 3.7V 650mAh for the Artemis and sensors.
                                    We are using the 850mAh one for the motors because the motors will use up the battery much faster. In addition, for the later labs we will be using motor drivers to control the 
                                    RC car's motors which will require more current. On the otherhand, the Artemis uses the 650mAh battery since it does 
                                    not require as much power.

                                    Aftwards I attached the 650mAh to the Artemis and everything to the RC car.
                                    I put one TOF sensor on the left side of the car and the other one on the front of the car. I mounted the IMU, Artemis,
                                    and QWIIC breakout board to one side of the car and the battery to the other side of the car.
                                    I was able to test and see that the bluetooth successfully connected and data collected and sent to my laptop to analyze and graph the outputs
                                    from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and TOF sensors.

                                    For motor control on the Artemis I ended up using pins 9 and 4 for the right motor
                                    and pins 6 and 7 for the left motor. Originally I wanted to use pins 12 and 13 however,
                                    after debugging it seemed there was an issue with sending signals from those pins.

                                    We power the the Artemis and the motors from separate batteries because they have different power requirements.
                                    The Artemis is powered by the 3.7V 650mAh battery. Whearas the motors are powered by the 3.7V 80mAh battery.
                                    The motors use up a lot of power/current which is the reason we should power them with a separate battery.

                                    I soldered both motor drivers at the same time so I didn't have to 
                                    do all the work for one and then repeat the process for the other.
                                    I connected the inputs and outputs of A to B the dual motor drivers by looping the wire between the pins and 
                                    using either heatshrink and solder to connect them in place.
                                    I also soldered wires for VIN and both GNDs (one to connect to the Artemis and the other to connect to the battery).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I ended up using solid core wires which might be a problem for later labs if I have to do repairs.
                                    I didn't think about using the stranded wires until after I finished soldering both of my motor drivers.
                                    One pro to using the solid core wires is that the motor drivers kinda just float in the air.
                                    The con to using solid-core wires is that they might break during some of the high acceleration tricks.
                                    But I guess I'll have to deal with the consequences in the following labs.

                                    I used the oscilloscope to display the motor driver outputs as I used analogWrite (values range from 0 to 255)
                                    to generate a PWM input from the Artemis. I kept one input at 0 and then adjusting the other input

                                    When testing one dual motor driver, I used an external power supply that hand
                                    an output voltage of 3.7V since when the car is running the battery we will use
                                    will be 3.7V 850mAh.

                                    I continued to use the oscilloscope to display the motor driver outputs.
                                    To change the direction of the motor (clockwise or counterclockwise) I switched
                                    the inputs for the one that is set to 0 and the one I was adjusting. If I wanted the motor to stop, both inputs

                                    Afterwards, I attached the motor driver to be powered by the battery and tested if both motors could run at the same time. 
                                    First I had both motors rotate in the clockwise direction (one forward, one backward) and then afterwards I changed the PWM input 
                                    for both motors to rotate in the forward direction and the backwards direction.

                                    One interesting issue I ran into was that the motors works fine when running them on their own and in opposite directions at the same time.
                                    However, when I tried to run them both in the forward direction my left motor did not spin. I debugged with the oscilloscope and the inputs to 
                                    the motor driver from the Artemis did not appear as desired. I ended up resoldering the motor driver inputs from pins 12 and 13 to pins 9 and 4.

                                    I was able to attached everything to the car by using electrical tape. The motor drivers ended up floating in the air.

                                    I tried running the car directly on the ground. In order to make it easier to send different PWM values to the motors, 
                                    I created a new command in ble_arduino to take in two inputs (one for each motor) and then run for a short period of time before stopping.
                                    The reason for using bluetooth is that I didn't want to continue compiling and burning code onto the Artemis if I only how to change a couple of values.

                                    To find the lower PWM value that the robot could move on the ground when starting from rest and when already in motion.
                                    After sending a variety of values to the robot, the lower PWM value to start the robot from rest is around 30.

                                    To find the lower PWM value that allows for the robot to move on when already running, I input different values starting from 
                                    50 and decrementing by intervals fo 5 until a value of 15. I also printed which value I was inputing so I could watch when the
                                    robot slows down and stops. It turned out the lower PWM value for when the robot is already running is around 20.

                                    For the calibration factor, I just played around with different input values on both motors until the car moved in a fairly straight line.
                                    My input values were 70 for the right motor and 50 for the left motor.

                                The purpose of lab 6 was to become familiar with using PID control. It is one part of a series of labs 
                                dealing with PID control, sensor fusion, and stunts. We were given the option of doing
                                position control or orientation control, I chose position control. We also had to choose a controller 
                                that would work best for our system, I chose PID.

                            <p>
                                For the prelab we had to establish a good system for debugging the rest of the lab. I made a copy of my bluetooth code
                                from the previous labs and cleaned it up to only have a few command for this lab.                                
                                I planned to use two bluetooth commands to communicate between my laptop and the Artemis. 
                                One command takes in the sensor meausurements, controls the robot, and stores 
                                the data in arrays. The other command sends the data that was stored in the arrays over bluetooth to my laptop in python. Since I knew 
                                I wanted to do position control which only requires me to save data about the time, TOF sensors, and motor speed. On the python side, 
                                I saved the arrays of data into pickle files so I could access the data to later on make graphs and for lab 7.

                                    At first I wasn't sure which controller I was going to use so I just implemented PID and planned to 
                                    incrementally pick the coefficients based on my results using the robot. The error was based on
                                    how the difference betweeen the tof sensor reading and 1ft (304mm) since the robot needed to stop
                                    about 1 ft away from the wall. I also had to adjust if the robot would go forward or backward
                                    depending on the error. I based my implementation on the slides provided to use in lecture and 
                                    also the implementation of PID from a class (ECE 4760 - Design Microcontrollers) that I took last 
                                    semester. The motor values are from 0-255 but as in the previous lab I found the lower PWM value to
                                    be around 30. However, I redid this and set the minmum value to 40 and then set the max value to 200.
                                </p>

                                    My bluetooth command allows me to input the kp, ki, and kd, values so I can quickly test out different
                                    values without having to edit the arduino code. My arrays had a size of about 200 and the motors had an
                                    automatic stop after running for 15sec. Some of the values in the array ended up being 0 so I made a function
                                    to get rid of the extra zeros that did not contribute to the data.
                                </p>

                                    I followed heuristic procedure #2 when deciding on the values. I set ki and kd to zero
                                    and adjusted the kp value. I started at a very small kp value (0.001)
                                    and increased the values until the robot stopped around 1ft away from the wall. The kp value was set to 0.004.

                                    Then I decrease the kp value by a factor of 2-4 and slowly increased ki until there was a loss of stability.
                                    The kp value was set to 0.0015 and the ki value was set to 0.003. As you can see the robot goes passed the 
                                    1ft mark but moved backwards to the proper position.

                                The purpose of lab 7 was to implement the Kalman Filter to help execute 
                                the task from lab 6 at a much faster speed. First we implemented the Kalman
                                Filer in python. For the last part of the lab we were supposed to implement 
                                the Kalman Filter directly on the robot however, due to the Snow Day we were
                                given the option to just extrapolate the next position based on the most recent time-of-flight 
                                data point.

                                    To estimate the drag and momentum, I used a step response to gather
                                    information about the motor input values and ToF sensor output.

                                    Based on the last trial of my lab 6, I chose the PWM value of my motor to be 200.
                                    In order to find the steady state velocity and the 90% rise time to get to the steady 
                                    state velocity, I had to do two different runs. The first run was starting the robot
                                    from over 4.5m (out of range for the ToF sensors) so I could see what the steady state
                                    velocity was. The second one was from less than 4.5m so I could properly see the 
                                    value of the 90% rise time.

                                    just seeing how well our model followed the senor data. I thought we had to use our extrapolator

                                <p>
                                    I edited my lab 7 code by deleting the pid control and using my extrapolator quickly calculate the
                                    distance from the robot to the wall. Once the robot gets within the range of the sticky mat it changes
                                    direction from forwards to backwards to initiate the flip. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Edited Code:

                                    I also ended up adding command inputs for the pwm values for each motor in the forward and 
                                    backward direction as well as the desired flip distance from the wall.

                                    I took many different trials in the hallway of Phillips Hall. As shown in the videos below there was much variety to 
                                    how the robot interacted in the hallway which lead to me getting closer to completing the stunt.
                                </p>

                                    This allowed me to see that the robot is about to go forward in a straight line and is able to reverse direction when it 
                                    gets to the specified distance from the wall. The issue here was that the motors were not fast enough to flip it over but 
                                    it was able to angle the robot in a different direction. I increased the motor input values but still tried to maintain the 
                                    straightness of robot which led to me having values of 250 and 192.

                                    The robot's behavior is similar to the previous video however, it is able to lift partially off the ground. I need to increase 
                                    the PWM values for the robot in the backwards direction.
                                </p>

                                    Then the robot was able to flip but it ends up rotating away from where it came from. Liam recommended slightly angling the 
                                    robot to account for the robots rotation during the turn. Then I was able to get actual trials for the robot. Yay!

                                    For the pre-lab we had to read through background information about
                                    localization, sensor model, motion model, and Bayes Filter Algorithm.
                                    This was so we could be prepared to implement everything in python.
                                    The purpose of localization is to determine where the robot is located based on it's 
                                    environment.

                                    and where the robot was supposed to be to compute the probability of where the robot 
                                    was expected to be versus where it actually is. This is done by using compute control 
                                    to get the control information based on the provided current position and previous position 
                                    then normalizing all the values of rotation1, translation1, and rotation2. Afterwards, 
                                    the probability is computed for each of these values by using the gaussian distribution on 
                                    difference between the actual and expected control variables with their respective sigmas.

                                    This is the prediction step of the Bayes Filter which updates the probabilites in the matrix
                                    bel_bar which is the prior belief before the latest measurement. The code loops through 
                                    the previous and current x, y, and rotation values to calculate the current position, previous
                                    position, the odometry model, and the belief based on the previous x, y, and rotation
                                    values. For this implementation, if the belief of the previou values is less than 0.0001 
                                    the next calculations are not done to mitigate the computational load. From here the summation of the product of odometry motion model and the belief
                                    is calculated. Then, the numbers are added together and normalize to return the prior belief.

                                    The sensor model is similar to the odometry model however, this function uses the gaussian distribution
                                    to calculate the likelihoods the each individual sensor measurement based on the data collected by the
                                    robot and the sensor sigma.

                                    This is the update step of the Bayes Filter which returns the belief of the robot based on all 
                                    the past sensor measurements and controls. It loops through the current x, y, and rotation values 
                                    and calculates the prior belief, sensor model, the product of the vales in the sensor model probability
                                    array. Then the belife is calculated by multiplying the product of the sensor model values by 
                                    the prior belief. Then this is normalized.

                                    the Bayes filter values. It doesn't seem to have done too bad.
